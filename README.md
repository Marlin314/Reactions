Reaction Architecture - Gesture based Music Notation Editor

This is the Code Base for the Intermediate Java course that I teach at NEU Seattle campus. In that course we build a single medium scale project (about 25 classes) over the course of a single semester. The documentation for my course is on my UW website which is at [CourseNotes](depts.washington.edu/cprogs)

If you go to that site, click on the Mid button (for Mid level, i.e. intermediate Java) to get to my course notes. I have not yet updated those notes, nor have I filled in this repository, but eventually I hope to rebuild the project from scratch and do commits at each significant rebuild or testing point. The plan is to include into my class notes markers so that at any marker a student can synch up their code base with where we are at that point in the course.

Eventually I will bring the course notes into this project as well so that it will all be here, but hey, Baby Steps.
